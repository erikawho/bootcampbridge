# bootcampbridge

October 4, 2016

This app is to help women and minorities on the path from attending a coding bootcamp to securing a software developer role.

1. Find scholarships for bootcamps.
2. Secure internships/apprenticeships post-bootcamp.
3. Network and connect with mentors for guidance. Instead of a forum, there would be an associated Slack channel.
4. Connect peers on a Slack channel.
